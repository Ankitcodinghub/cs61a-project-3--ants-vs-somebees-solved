Introduction

Important submission note: For full credit,

Try to attempt the problems in order, as some later problems will depend on earlier problems in their implementation and therefore also when running ok tests.

The entire project can be completed with a partner.

In this project, you will create a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees‚Äô wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games‚Äô Plants Vs. Zombies.

This project uses an object-oriented programming paradigm, focusing on material from Chapter 2.5 of Composing Programs. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.

When students in the past have tried to implement the functions without thoroughly reading the problem description, they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve often run into issues. √∞≈∏Àú¬± Read each description thoroughly before starting to code.

Download starter files

The ants.zip archive contains several files, but all of your changes will be made to ants.py.

ants.py: The game logic of Ants Vs. SomeBees ants_gui.py: The original GUI for Ants Vs. SomeBees gui.py: A new GUI for Ants Vs. SomeBees.

graphics.py: Utilities for displaying simple two-dimensional animations utils.py: Some functions to facilitate the game interface ucb.py: Utility functions for CS 61A state.py: Abstraction for gamestate for gui.py assets: A directory of images and files used by gui.py img: A directory of images used by ants_gui.py ok: The autograder

proj3.ok: The ok configuration file tests: A directory of tests used by ok

Logistics

You will turn in the following files:

ants.py

You do not need to modify or turn in any other files to complete the project. To submit the project, run the following command:

python3 ok ‚Äìsubmit

You will be able to view your submissions on the Ok dashboard.

Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your code. It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate any problems. However, you should not be testing too often, to allow yourself time to think through problems.

We have provided an autograder called ok to help you with testing your code and tracking your progress. The first time you run the autograder, you will be asked to log in with your Ok account using your web browser. Please do so. Each time you run ok, it will back up your work and progress on our servers.

The primary purpose of ok is to test your implementations.

We recommend that you submit after you finish each problem. Only your last submission will be graded. It is also useful for us to have more backups of your code in case you run into a submission issue. If you forget to submit, your last backup will be automatically converted to a submission.

If you do not want us to record a backup of your work or information about your progress, you can run

python3 ok ‚Äìlocal

With this option, no information will be sent to our course servers. If you want to test your code interactively, you can run

python3 ok -q [question number] -i

with the appropriate question number (e.g. 01) inserted. This will run the tests for that question until the first one you failed, then give you a chance to test the functions you wrote interactively.

You can also use the debugging print feature in OK by writing

py print(‚ÄúDEBUG:‚Äù, x) which will produce an output in your terminal without causing OK tests to fail with extra output.

The Game

Core concepts

The Colony. This is where the game takes place. The colony consists of several Places that are chained together to form a tunnel where bees can travel through. The colony also has some quantity of food which can be expended in order to place an ant in a tunnel.

Places. A place links to another place to form a tunnel. The player can put a single ant into each place. However, there can be many bees in a single place.

The Hive. This is the place where bees originate. Bees exit the beehive to enter the ant colony.

Ants. Players place an ant into the colony by selecting from the available ant types at the top of the screen. Each type of ant takes a different action and requires a different amount of colony food to place. The two most basic ant types are the HarvesterAnt, which adds one food to the colony during each turn, and the ThrowerAnt, which throws a leaf at a bee each turn. You will be implementing many more!

Bees. In this game, bees are the antagonistic forces that the player must defend the ant colony from. Each turn, a bee either advances to the next place in the tunnel if no ant is in its way, or it stings the ant in its way. Bees win when at least one bee reaches the end of a tunnel.

Core classes

The concepts described above each have a corresponding class that encapsulates the logic for that concept. Here is a summary of the main classes involved in this game:

GameState: Represents the colony and some state information about the game, including how much food is available, how much time has elapsed, where the AntHomeBase is, and all the Places in the game.

Place: Represents a single place that holds insects. At most one Ant can be in a single place, but there can be many Bees in a single place.

Place objects have an exit to the left and an entrance to the right, which are also places. Bees travel through a tunnel by moving to a

Place‚Äôs exit.

Hive: Represents the place where Bees start out (on the right of the tunnel).

AntHomeBase: Represents the place Ants are defending (on the left of the tunnel). If Bees get here, they win üôÅ

Insect: A superclass for Ant and Bee. All insects have health attribute, representing their remaining health, and a place attribute, representing the Place where they are currently located. Each turn, every active Insect in the game performs its action.

Ant: Represents ants. Each Ant subclass has special attributes or a special action that distinguish it from other Ant types. For example, a HarvesterAnt gets food for the colony and a ThrowerAnt attacks Bees. Each ant type also has a food_cost attribute that indicates how much it costs to deploy one unit of that type of ant.

Bee: Represents bees. Each turn, a bee either moves to the exit of its current Place if the Place is not blocked by an ant, or stings the ant occupying its same Place.

Game Layout

Below is a visualization of a GameState. As you work through the unlocking tests and problems, we recommend drawing out similar diagrams to help your understanding.

Object map

To help visualize how all the classes fit together, we‚Äôve also created an object map for you to reference as you work, which you can find here:

Playing the game

The game can be run in two modes: as a text-based game or using a graphical user interface (GUI). The game logic is the same in either case, but the GUI enforces a turn time limit that makes playing the game more exciting. The text-based interface is provided for debugging and development.

The files are separated according to these two modes. ants.py knows nothing of graphics or turn time limits. To start a text-based game, run

python3 ants_text.py

To start a graphical game, run

python3 gui.py

The game has several options that you will use throughout the project, which you can view with python3 ants_text.py ‚Äìhelp.

‚Äú` usage: ants_text.py [-h] [-d DIFFICULTY] [-w] [‚Äìfood FOOD] Play Ants vs. SomeBees

optional arguments: -h, ‚Äìhelp show this help message and exit -d DIFFICULTY sets difficulty of game (test/easy/normal/hard/extra-hard) -w, -water loads a full layout with water ‚Äìfood FOOD number of food to start with when testing ‚Äú`

Phase 1: Basic gameplay

In the first phase you will complete the implementation that will allow for basic gameplay with the two basic Ants: the HarvesterAnt and the

ThrowerAnt.

Problem 0 (0 pt)

Answer the following questions after you have read the entire ants.py file.

To submit your answers, run:

python3 ok -q 00 -u

If you get stuck while answering these questions, you can try reading through ants.py again, consult the core concepts/classes sections above, or ask a question in the Question 0 thread on Piazza.

1. What is the significance of an Insect‚Äôs health attribute? Does this value change? If so, how?

2. Which of the following is a class attribute of the Insect class?

3. Is the health attribute of the Ant class an instance attribute or a class attribute? Why?

4. Is the damage attribute of an Ant subclass (such as ThrowerAnt) an instance attribute or class attribute? Why?

5. Which class do both Ant and Bee inherit from?

6. What do instances of Ant and instances of Bee have in common?

7. How many insects can be in a single Place at any given time (before Problem 8)?

8. What does a Bee do during one of its turns?

9. When is the game lost?

Remember to run: python3 ok -q 00 -u

A note on unlocking tests: If you‚Äôd like to review the unlocking questions after you have completed the unlocking test, you can navigate to (within the ants folder), the tests folder. For example, after unlocking Problem 0, you can review the unlocking test at tests/00.py.

Problem 1 (1 pt)

Part A: Currently, there is no cost for placing any type of Ant, and so there is no challenge to the game. The base class Ant has a food_cost of zero. Override this class attribute for HarvesterAnt and ThrowerAnt according to the ‚ÄúFood Cost‚Äù column in the table below.

Class Food Cost Initial Health

`HarvesterAnt` 2 1

`ThrowerAnt` 3 1

Part B: Now that placing an Ant costs food, we need to be able to gather more food! To fix this issue, implement the HarvesterAnt class. A HarvesterAnt is a type of Ant that adds one food to the gamestate.food total as its action.

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question:

python3 ok -q 01 -u

Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:

python3 ok -q 01

Try playing the game by running python3 gui.py. Once you have placed a HarvesterAnt, you should accumulate food each turn. You can also place ThrowerAnts, but you‚Äôll see that they can only attack bees that are in their Place, making it a little difficult to win.

Problem 2 (1 pt)

In this problem, you‚Äôll complete Place.__init__ by adding code that tracks entrances. Right now, a Place keeps track only of its exit. We would like a Place to keep track of its entrance as well. A Place needs to track only one entrance. Tracking entrances will be useful when an Ant needs to see what Bees are in front of it in the tunnel.

However, simply passing an entrance to a Place constructor will be problematic; we would need to have both the exit and the entrance before creating a Place! (It‚Äôs a chicken or the egg problem.) To get around this problem, we will keep track of entrances in the following way instead. Place.__init__ should use this logic:

A newly created Place always starts with its entrance as None.

If the Place has an exit, then the exit‚Äôs entrance is set to that Place.

Hint: Remember that when the __init__ method is called, the first parameter, self, is bound to the newly created object

Hint: Try drawing out two Places next to each other if things get confusing. In the GUI, a place‚Äôs entrance is to its right while the exit is to its left.

Hint: Remember that Places are not stored in a list, so you can‚Äôt index into anything to access them. This means that you can‚Äôt do something like colony[index + 1] to access an adjacent Place. How can you move from one place to another?

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question:

python3 ok -q 02 -u

Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:

python3 ok -q 02

Problem 3 (2 pt)

In order for a ThrowerAnt to throw a leaf, it must know which bee to hit. The provided implementation of the nearest_bee method in the ThrowerAnt class only allows them to hit bees in the same Place. Your job is to fix it so that a ThrowerAnt will throw_at the nearest bee in front of it that is not still in the Hive. This includes bees that are in the same Place as a ThrowerAnt

Hint: All Places have an is_hive attribute which is True when that place is the Hive.

Change nearest_bee so that it returns a random Bee from the nearest place that contains bees. Your implementation should follow this logic:

Start from the current Place of the ThrowerAnt.

For each place, return a random bee if there is any, and if not, inspect the place in front of it (stored as the current place‚Äôs entrance). If there is no bee to attack, return None.

Hint: The random_bee function provided in ants.py returns a random bee from a list of bees or None if the list is empty.

Hint: As a reminder, if there are no bees present at a Place, then the bees attribute of that Place instance will be an empty list.

Hint: Having trouble visualizing the test cases? Try drawing them out on paper! The sample diagram provided in Game Layout shows the first test case for this problem.

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question:

python3 ok -q 03 -u

Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:

python3 ok -q 03

After implementing nearest_bee, a ThrowerAnt should be able to throw_at a Bee in front of it that is not still in the Hive. Make sure that your ants do the right thing! To start a game with ten food (for easy testing):

python3 gui.py ‚Äìfood 10

python3 ok ‚Äìsubmit

You can check to ensure that you have completed Phase 1‚Äôs problems by running:

python3 ok ‚Äìscore

Congratulations! You have finished Phase 1 of this project!

Phase 2: Ants!

Important submission note: For full credit,

Now that you‚Äôve implemented basic gameplay with two types of Ants, let‚Äôs add some flavor to the ways ants can attack bees. In this phase, you‚Äôll be implementing several different Ants with different attack strategies.

After you implement each Ant subclass in this section, you‚Äôll need to set its implemented class attribute to True so that that type of ant will show up in the GUI. Feel free to try out the game with each new ant to test the functionality!

With your Phase 2 ants, try python3 gui.py -d easy to play against a full swarm of bees in a multi-tunnel layout and try -d normal, -d hard, or -d extra-hard if you want a real challenge! If the bees are too numerous to vanquish, you might need to create some new ants.

Problem 4 (2 pt)

A ThrowerAnt is a powerful threat to the bees, but it has a high food cost. In this problem, you‚Äôll implement two subclasses of ThrowerAnt that are less costly but have constraints on the distance they can throw:

The LongThrower can only throw_at a Bee that is found after following at least 5 entrance transitions. It cannot hit Bees that are in the same Place as it or the first 4 Places in front of it. If there are two Bees, one too close to the LongThrower and the other within its range, the LongThrower should only throw at the farther Bee, which is within its range, instead of trying to hit the closer Bee.

The ShortThrower can only throw_at a Bee that is found after following at most 3 entrance transitions. It cannot throw at any bees further than 3 Places in front of it.

Neither of these specialized throwers can throw_at a Bee that is exactly 4 Places away.

Class Food Cost Initial Health

`ShortThrower` 2 1

`LongThrower` 2 1

To implement these new throwing ants, your ShortThrower and LongThrower classes should inherit the nearest_bee method from the base ThrowerAnt class. The logic of choosing which bee a thrower ant will attack is the same, except the ShortThrower and LongThrower ants have a maximum and minimum range, respectively.

To do this, modify the nearest_bee method to reference min_range and max_range attributes, and only return a bee if it is within range.

Make sure to give these min_range and max_range attributes appropriate values in the ThrowerAnt class so that the behavior of ThrowerAnt is unchanged. Then, implement the subclasses LongThrower and ShortThrower with appropriately constrained ranges.

You should not need to repeat any code between ThrowerAnt, ShortThrower, and LongThrower.

Hint: float(‚Äòinf‚Äô) returns an infinite positive value represented as a float that can be compared with other numbers.

Hint: You can chain inequalities in Python: e.g. 2 &lt; x &lt; 6 will check if x is between 2 and 6. Also, min_range and max_range should mark an inclusive range.

Important: Make sure your class attributes are called max_range and min_range The tests directly reference these attribute names, and will error if you use another name for these attributes.

Don‚Äôt forget to set the implemented class attribute of LongThrower and ShortThrower to True.

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question:

python3 ok -q 04 -u

After writing code, test your implementation (rerun the tests for 03 to make sure they still work):

python3 ok -q 03 python3 ok -q 04

Problem 5 (3 pt)

Implement the FireAnt, which does damage when it receives damage. Specifically, if it is damaged by amount health units, it does a damage of amount to all bees in its place (this is called reflected damage). If it dies, it does an additional amount of damage, as specified by its damage attribute, which has a default value of 3 as defined in the FireAnt class.

To implement this, override Ant‚Äôs reduce_health method. Your overriden method should call the reduce_health method inherited from the superclass (Ant) to reduce the current FireAnt instance‚Äôs health. Calling the inherited reduce_health method on a FireAnt instance reduces the insect‚Äôs health by the given amount and removes the insect from its place if its health reaches zero or lower.

Hint: Do not call self.reduce_health, or you‚Äôll end up stuck in a recursive loop. (Can you see why?)

However, your method needs to also include the reflective damage logic:

Determine the reflective damage amount: start with the amount inflicted on the ant, and then add damage if the ant‚Äôs health has dropped to

0.

For each bee in the place, damage them with the total amount by calling the appropriate reduce_health method for each bee.

Important: Remember that when any Ant loses all its health, it is removed from its place, so pay careful attention to the order of your logic in reduce_health.

lst = [1,2,3,4] lst[:] [1, 2, 3, 4] list(lst) [1, 2, 3, 4] lst[:] is not lst and list(lst) is not lst True ‚Äú`

Once you‚Äôve finished implementing the FireAnt, give it a class attribute implemented with the value True.

Note: Even though you are overriding the superclass‚Äôs reduce_health function (Ant.reduce_health), you can still use this method in your implementation by calling it. Note this is not recursion. (Why not?)

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question:

python3 ok -q 05 -u

Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:

python3 ok -q 05

You can also test your program by playing a game or two! A FireAnt should destroy all co-located Bees when it is stung. To start a game with ten food (for easy testing):

python3 gui.py ‚Äìfood 10

Problem 6 (1 pt)

We are going to add some protection to our glorious home base by implementing the WallAnt, an ant that does nothing each turn. A WallAnt is useful because it has a large health value.

Class Food Cost Initial Health

`WallAnt` 4 4

Unlike with previous ants, we have not provided you with a class header. Implement the WallAnt class from scratch. Give it a class attribute name with the value ‚ÄòWall‚Äô (so that the graphics work) and a class attribute implemented with the value True (so that you can use it in a game).

Hint: To start, take a look at how the previous problems‚Äô ants were implemented!

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question:

python3 ok -q 06 -u

Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:

python3 ok -q 06

Problem 7 (3 pt)

Implement the HungryAnt, which will select a random Bee from its place and deal damage to the bee by eating it whole. After eating a Bee, a HungryAnt must spend 3 turns chewing before being able to eat again. While the HungryAnt is chewing, it is not able to eat (deal damage to) any Bee‚Äôs. After 3 turns, if there is no bee available to eat, the HungryAnt will do nothing.

We have not provided you with a class header. Implement the HungryAnt class from scratch. Give it a class attribute name with the value ‚ÄòHungry‚Äô (so that the graphics work) and a class attribute implemented with the value True (so that you can use it in a game).

Hint: When a Bee is eaten, it should lose all its health. Is there an existing function we can call on a Bee that can reduce its health to

0?

Class Food Cost Initial Health

`HungryAnt` 4 1

Give HungryAnt a time_to_chew class attribute that stores the number of turns that it will take a HungryAnt to chew (set to 3). Also, give each HungryAnt an instance attribute chew_timer that counts the number of turns it has left to chew (initialized to 0, since it hasn‚Äôt eaten anything at the beginning. You can also think of chew_timer as the number of turns until a HungryAnt can eat another Bee).

Implement the action method of the HungryAnt: First, check if it is chewing; if so, decrement its chew_timer. Otherwise, eat a random Bee in its place by reducing the Bee‚Äôs health to 0. Make sure to set the chew_timer when a Bee is eaten!

Hint: Other than the action method, make sure you implement the __init__ method too so the HungryAnt starts off with the appropriate amount of health!

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question:

python3 ok -q 07 -u

Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:

python3 ok -q 07

We now have some great offensive troops to help vanquish the bees, but let‚Äôs make sure we‚Äôre also keeping our defensive efforts up. In this phase you will implement ants that have special defensive capabilities such as increased health and the ability to protect other ants.

√∞≈∏‚Äò¬©√∞≈∏¬Ω√¢‚Ç¨√∞≈∏‚Äô¬ª√∞≈∏‚Äò¬®√∞≈∏¬ø√¢‚Ç¨√∞≈∏‚Äô¬ª Pair programming? This would be a good time to switch roles. Switching roles makes sure that you both benefit from the learning experience of being in each role.

Problem 8 (3 pt)

Right now, our ants are quite frail. We‚Äôd like to provide a way to help them last longer against the onslaught of the bees. Enter the BodyguardAnt.

Class Food Cost Initial Health

`BodyguardAnt` 4 2

A BodyguardAnt differs from a normal ant because it is a ContainerAnt; it can contain another ant and protect it, all in one Place. When a Bee stings the ant in a Place where one ant contains another, only the container is damaged. The ant inside the container can still perform its original action. If the container perishes, the contained ant still remains in the place (and can then be damaged).

Each ContainerAnt has an instance attribute ant_contained that stores the ant it contains. This ant, ant_contained, initially starts off as None to indicate that there is no ant being stored yet. Implement the store_ant method so that it sets the ContainerAnt‚Äôs ant_contained instance attribute to the passed in ant argument. Also implement the ContainerAnt‚Äôs action method to perform its ant_contained‚Äôs action if it is currently containing an ant.

In addition, you will need to make the following modifications throughout your program so that a container and its contained ant can both occupy a place at the same time (a maximum of two ants per place), but only if exactly one is a container:

1. There is an Ant.can_contain method, but it always returns False. Override the method ContainerAnt.can_contain so that it takes an ant other as an argument and returns True if:

This ContainerAnt does not already contain another ant. The other ant is not a container.

2. Modify Ant.add_to to allow a container and a non-container ant to occupy the same place according to the following rules:

If the ant originally occupying a place can contain the ant being added, then both ants occupy the place and original ant contains the ant being added.

If the ant being added can contain the ant originally in the space, then both ants occupy the place and the (container) ant being added contains the original ant.

If neither Ant can contain the other, raise the same AssertionError as before (the one already present in the starter code). Important: If there are two ants in a specific Place, the ant attribute of the Place instance should refer to the container ant, and the container ant should contain the non-container ant.

3. Add a BodyguardAnt.__init__ that sets the initial amount of health for the ant.

The constructor of ContainerAnt.__init__ is implemented as follows: py def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs): super().__init__(*args, **kwargs) self.ant_contained = None

As we saw in Hog, args is bound to all positional arguments (which are all arguments passed without keywords), and kwargs is bound to all the keyword arguments. This ensures that both sets of arguments are passed to the Ant constructor.

Effectively, this means the constructor is exactly the same as its parent class‚Äôs constructor (Ant.__init__) but here we also set self.ant_contained = None.

Once you‚Äôve finished implementing the BodyguardAnt, give it a class attribute implemented with the value True.

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question:

python3 ok -q 08 -u

Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:

python3 ok -q 08

Problem 9 (1 pt)

The BodyguardAnt provides great defense, but they say the best defense is a good offense. The TankAnt is a container that protects an ant in its place and also deals 1 damage to all bees in its place each turn.

We have not provided you with a class header. Implement the TankAnt class from scratch. Give it a class attribute name with the value ‚ÄòTank‚Äô (so that the graphics work) and a class attribute implemented with the value True (so that you can use it in a game).

You should not need to modify any code outside of the TankAnt class. If you find yourself needing to make changes elsewhere, look for a way to write your code for the previous question such that it applies not just to BodyguardAnt and TankAnt objects, but to container ants in general.

Hint: The only methods you need to override from TankAnt‚Äôs parent class are __init__ and action.

Hint: Like with FireAnt, it is possible that damaging a bee will cause it to be removed from its place.

Phase 3: Water and Might

Important submission note: For full credit,

In the final phase, you‚Äôre going to add one last kick to the game by introducing a new type of place and new ants that are able to occupy this place. One of these ants is the most important ant of them all: the queen of the colony!

Problem 10 (1 pt)

Let‚Äôs add water to the colony! Currently there are only two types of places, the Hive and a basic Place. To make things more interesting, we‚Äôre going to create a new type of Place called Water.

Only an insect that is waterproof can be placed in Water. In order to determine whether an Insect is waterproof, add a new class attribute to the Insect class named is_waterproof that is set to False. Since bees can fly, set their is_waterproof attribute to True, overriding the inherited value.

Now, implement the add_insect method for Water. First, add the insect to the place regardless of whether it is waterproof. Then, if the insect is not waterproof, reduce the insect‚Äôs health to 0. Do not repeat code from elsewhere in the program. Instead, use methods that have already been defined.

Once you‚Äôve finished this problem, play a game that includes water. To access the wet_layout, which includes water, add the ‚Äìwater option (or -w for short) when you start the game.

Problem 11 (1 pt)

Currently there are no ants that can be placed on Water. Implement the ScubaThrower, which is a subclass of ThrowerAnt that is more costly and waterproof, but otherwise identical to its base class. A ScubaThrower should not lose its health when placed in Water.

`ScubaThrower` 6 1

We have not provided you with a class header. Implement the ScubaThrower class from scratch. Give it a class attribute name with the value ‚ÄòScuba‚Äô (so that the graphics work) and remember to set the class attribute implemented with the value True (so that you can use it in a game).

Problem 12 (3 pt)

Finally, implement the QueenAnt. The queen is a waterproof ScubaThrower that inspires her fellow ants through her bravery. In addition to the standard ScubaThrower action, the QueenAnt doubles the damage of all the ants behind her each time she performs an action. Once an ant‚Äôs damage has been doubled, it is not doubled again for subsequent turns.

Note: The reflected damage of a FireAnt should not be doubled, only the extra damage it deals when its health is reduced to 0.

Class Food Cost Initial Health

`QueenAnt` 7 1

However, with great power comes great responsibility. The QueenAnt is governed by three special rules:

1. If the queen ever has its health reduced to 0, the ants lose. You will need to override Ant.reduce_health in QueenAnt and call ants_lose() in that case in order to signal to the simulator that the game is over. (The ants also still lose if any bee reaches the end of a tunnel.)

2. There can be only one queen. A second queen cannot be constructed. To check if an Ant can be constructed, we use the

Ant.construct() class method to either construct an Ant if possible, or return None if not. You will need to override Ant.construct as a class method of QueenAnt in order to add this check. To keep track of whether a queen has already been created, you can use an instance variable added to the current GameState.

3. The queen cannot be removed. Attempts to remove the queen should have no effect (but should not cause an error). You will need to override Ant.remove_from in QueenAnt to enforce this condition.

Hint: Think about how you can call the construct method of the superclass of QueenAnt. Remember that you ultimately want to construct a QueenAnt, not a regular Ant or a ScubaThrower.

Hint: You can find each Place in a tunnel behind the QueenAnt by starting at the ant‚Äôs place.exit and then repeatedly following its exit. The exit of a Place at the end of a tunnel is None.

Hint: To avoid doubling an ant‚Äôs damage twice, mark the ants that have been double damaged in a way that persists across calls to QueenAnt.action.

Hint: When doubling the ants‚Äô damage, keep in mind that there can be more than one ant in a Place, such as if one ant is guarding another.

Extra Credit (2 pt)

Implement two final thrower ants that do zero damage, but instead apply a temporary ‚Äústatus‚Äù on the action method of a Bee instance that they throw_at. This ‚Äústatus‚Äù lasts for a certain number of turns, after which it ceases to take effect.

We will be implementing two new ants that inherit from ThrowerAnt.

SlowThrower throws sticky syrup at a bee, slowing it for 3 turns. When a bee is slowed, it can only move on turns when gamestate.time is even, and can do nothing otherwise. If a bee is hit by syrup while it is already slowed, it is slowed for an additional 3 turns.

ScaryThrower intimidates a nearby bee, causing it to back away instead of advancing. (If the bee is already right next to the Hive and cannot go back further, it should not move. To check if a bee is next to the Hive, you might find the is_hive instance attribute of Places useful). Bees remain scared until they have tried to back away twice. Bees cannot try to back away if they are slowed and gamestate.time is odd. Once a bee has been scared once, it can‚Äôt be scared ever again.

Important update (3/7): Previously, the spec mentioned that ‚ÄúBees will not back up when scared if they are slowed.‚Äù However, the actual behavior of this should be, ‚ÄúBees will not back up when scared if they are slowed and gamestate.time is odd.‚Äù as described and seen in the behavior of the doctests (which have not changed). The spec description has now been updated to reflect this behavior.

Note: This change only affects the spec on this page, and not* the tests for the question itself.* Since the tests are still correct, there is nothing to redownload for this change.

Make sure to test your code! Your code should be able to apply multiple statuses on a target; each new status applies to the current (possibly previously affected) action method of the bee.

Optional Problems

Optional Problem 1

Implement the NinjaAnt, which damages all Bees that pass by, but can never be stung.

Class Food Cost Initial Health

`NinjaAnt` 5 1

A NinjaAnt does not block the path of a Bee that flies by. To implement this behavior, first modify the Ant class to include a new class attribute blocks_path that is set to True, then override the value of blocks_path to False in the NinjaAnt class.

Second, modify the Bee‚Äôs method blocked to return False if either there is no Ant in the Bee‚Äôs place or if there is an Ant, but its blocks_path attribute is False. Now Bees will just fly past NinjaAnts.

Finally, we want to make the NinjaAnt damage all Bees that fly past. Implement the action method in NinjaAnt to reduce the health of all

Bees in the same place as the NinjaAnt by its damage attribute. Similar to the FireAnt, you must iterate over a potentially changing list of bees.

Optional Problem 2

We‚Äôve been developing this ant for a long time in secret. It‚Äôs so dangerous that we had to lock it in the super hidden CS61A underground vault, but we finally think it is ready to go out on the field. In this problem, you‚Äôll be implementing the final ant ‚Äî LaserAnt, a ThrowerAnt with a twist.

Class Food Cost Initial Health

`LaserAnt` 10 1

The LaserAnt shoots out a powerful laser, damaging all that dare to stand in its path. Both Bees and Ants, of all types, are at risk of being damaged by LaserAnt. When a LaserAnt takes its action, it will damage all Insects in its place (excluding itself, but including its container if it has one) and the Places in front of it, excluding the Hive.

The exact order in which things are damaged within a turn is unspecified.

In order to complete the implementation of this ultimate ant, read through the LaserAnt class, set the class attributes appropriately, and implement the following two functions:

1. insects_in_front is an instance method, called by the action method, that returns a dictionary where each key is an Insect and each corresponding value is the distance (in places) that that Insect is away from LaserAnt. The dictionary should include all Insects on the same place or in front of the LaserAnt, excluding LaserAnt itself.

2. calculate_damage is an instance method that takes in distance, the distance that an insect is away from the LaserAnt instance. It returns the damage that the LaserAnt instance should afflict based on:

3. The distance away from the LaserAnt instance that an Insect is.

4. The number of Insects that this LaserAnt has damaged, stored in the insects_shot instance attribute.
